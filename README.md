# Primary_Structure_Compare
This repository contains the ability to input two amino acid one letter code sequences to compare their binding interactions at each position. 
"Primary_Structure_COmpare" is the code that allows direct file opening into the command line or allows a user to run the code directly in an IDE (Pycharm, VS code etc)

"compare_amino_acid_reactions_PSC" and "get_amino_acid_sequences_PSC" are individual functions. They can be combined to be run from the command line using the "Command_Line_Prompts_PSC"
